# iSH

Collection of mods and tweaks for rebuilding the filesystem of [iSH app](https://github.com/ish-app/ish).

iSH doesn't yet support themes and custom terminal colours. In my other tools I'm using the [Dracula Theme](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme), I've edited the `.bash_profile` and the `.dir_colors` to use the official Ansi 256 colour pallet of Dracula. Dircolors is edited from [Solarized Dircolors](https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized).
